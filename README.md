# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

In this challenge, we took some earthquake data from USGS, mapped it with Mapbox and added a layer of the world's tectonic plates from Github. We also included multiple different styles of maps to view the data and added a filter/legend to the page to show/hide the different layers of data.
